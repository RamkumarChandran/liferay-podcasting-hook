This application is a simple extension to the Blogs portlet
and enables blogs to publish podcasts. 

By entering Enclosure URL, length and type, these will be 
displayed at the blog post and added embedded in the RSS 
feed for the blog.

This application utilized Custom Fields (Expandos). The 
required Expando fields will be generated on startup.
If you have more custom fields for Blog Entries, they will 
be shown together with the podcast enclosure fields in the 
order defined by Liferay's internal order of those fields. 
The blog entry's "view" will show the custom fields that 
it knows about in an abbreviated form, e.g. it comes with 
an icon for enclosure type "audio/mpeg" that will be shown 
as demonstrated in one of the screenshots.
